In this research we tried to develop 2 Convolutional Neural Networks, both of which leverage thoracic X-ray images to predict the presence of cardiomegaly disease in a patient. 

## Introduction to Cardiomegaly 
Cardiomegaly, also known as an enlarged heart, is a medical condition characterized by an increase in the size of the heart. It is not a disease itself but rather a sign or symptom of an underlying cardiac disorder. Cardiomegaly can result from various conditions that put strain on the heart, such as hypertension (high blood pressure), coronary artery disease, heart valve problems, or cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle).

When the heart becomes enlarged, it may not function efficiently, leading to complications such as reduced cardiac output, impaired pumping ability, and increased risk of heart failure. Common symptoms associated with cardiomegaly include shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the legs and ankles, and irregular heartbeats.

The diagnosis of cardiomegaly is typically made using imaging techniques such as X-rays, echocardiograms, or cardiac MRI scans. These tests provide detailed images of the heart's structure and size, enabling healthcare professionals to assess the severity of the condition.

Early detection of cardiomegaly is crucial for timely intervention and management of the underlying cardiac condition. Medical interventions may include medication to manage symptoms, lifestyle modifications (such as dietary changes and exercise), and, in severe cases, surgical interventions like valve repair or heart transplantation.

With advancements in medical imaging and machine learning techniques, there is growing interest in developing automated systems for the detection and prediction of cardiomegaly. These systems, often based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other machine learning algorithms, aim to analyze medical images and aid in the early detection and accurate diagnosis of cardiomegaly, assisting healthcare professionals in providing better patient care.

Further research and advancements in this field are necessary to improve the accuracy and reliability of cardiomegaly detection, which could potentially lead to better treatment outcomes and enhanced management of cardiac conditions.
